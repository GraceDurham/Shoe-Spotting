# Shoespotting WIP Readme

Shoe spotting was created to entertain. It's a fun way of posting shoes from the web and commenting on them. This app allows users to comment on their own posts and also comment on the posts of others. It's a great way of tracking shoes you've discovered on the web, and optionally tracking how much they cost. It's like Pinterest for shoes!
